# Movie Recommender System
This project is the final project of the of the Data Science Bootcamp with Coding Dojo Academy & Saudi Digital Academy (SDA)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
Recommender System is one of the most popular data science applications.
Itâ€™s widely used and extremely helpful! And it can be applied for many ideas with variety of applications.
Basically, it predicts or offer services/products to the users/customers,
which can be done based on their past purchase, browsing history, or their type/classification.

### Methods Used
* Content-based Filtering of Recommender Systems
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Data Processing
* Data Scaling
* Data Modeling
* Data Optimization
* K-nearest neighbor Classifier Model

### Technologies
* Python
* Scikit Learn
* Mat Plot
* Pandas
* Google Colaboratory
* GitHub

## Project Description
The system will employees a machine learning algorithm, to predict the movie,
which the user may like based on the movies similarities and attributes (its: ID, title, rating, released year, genres)
Along with using the content-based filtering of recommender systems and the KNN classifier model,
that classifies k number of near neighbors to be on the same category. 

## Needs of this project
- advanced python Programmer
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- Recommender Systems understanding

## Getting Started
1. You can open and launch this [notebook](https://github.com/shi5a/MovieRecommender/blob/main/Recommender_System1.ipynb) via Goolge Colaboratory  
2. Data raw are uploaded from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shi5a/MovieRecommender) in the same notebook
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept in the same notebook
